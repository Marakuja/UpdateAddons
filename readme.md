## A simple script to keep your World of Warcraft Addons up to date

I just don't want to use the Twitch Client anymore for updating my addons. And after seeing amazing projects in scripting like the python variant from Derek Kuhnert's [wow-addon-updater](https://github.com/kuhnerdm/wow-addon-updater) written in python, I want to have something similar for the .NET world with powershell.

My script is heavily copied from the ideas from Peter Provost's [update-addons.ps1](https://github.com/PProvost/dotfiles/blob/master/powershell/modules/posh-wow/update-addons.ps1). But I updated it to today's websites and tweaked it here and there.

## Usage

This addon uses a csv file to manage addon information you want to keep updated. This has to be stored in the same path as the `update-addons.ps1` file.

Use `.\updateaddons.ps1 -scan` in powershell to see which addons are currently stored in your WoW/Interface/Addons directory to help you configure the csv file.

To run, execute `.\UpdateAddons.ps1` in powershell or doubleclick `Start_UpdateAddons.bat`.

### scoop

You can also use this script with [scoop](https://scoop.sh/). Just install this script with the
following command

> scoop install https://github.com/Marakuja/UpdateAddons/blob/master/UpdateAddons.json

### addons.csv

First line is always the base description:

>Name,Source,UID

The data is stored in each line representing the info, seperated by commas:

| field  | description                                       | valid parameters                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | the Name of the folder you see when used the scan | string                                        |
| Source | the Website to look for the addon                 | curseforge, wowinterface, packaged-with, skip |
| UID    | the identifier of the addon                       | string in url                                 |

e.g. for Weakauras you have the following data in the file (from url): `https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2`

>Name,Source,UID
>
>WeakAuras,curseforge,weakauras-2

e.g. for BigWigs you have the following data in the file (from url):
`https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info5086-BigWigsBossmods.html`

>Name,Source,UID
>
>BigWigs,wowi,5086
